Assignment (Lecture:3 to 5)

1. Given an integer n, print a nXn matrix with squares (outermost to innermost) having values n, then n-1 and so on.
For example, given 5, output is:
```
5 5 5 5 5
5 4 4 4 5
5 4 3 4 5
5 4 4 4 5 
5 5 5 5 5
```

2. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
    ```
    Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
    Output : 
    List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23'] 
    Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
    ```

3. Write a Python program to concatenate all elements in a list into a string and return it.
    ```
    Sample input : ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    Output : 'abcd'
    ```
    
4. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence.

5. Write a Python function to find all distinct pair of numbers whose product is odd from a sequence of integer values.

6. Write a simple Python program which inputs and stores the data about university students as a list of dictionaries. Your final record structure should look like this:
    ```
     [
         {
             'roll-no': 1211,
             'name': 'Ravi',
             'branch': 'CSE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 202,
             'name': 'Abhishek',
             'branch': 'SE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 1202,
             'name': 'Sachin',
             'branch': 'IT'
         }
     ]
    ```

7. Solve the following subdomains on hackerrank:

8. Write a Python class named `Circle` constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.

9. Write a python class with name `List` which behaves like the `list` data structure in Python. Initially, the `List` object must store an empty list. It should have following methods:
	- `size()`: return the size of List
	- `append(x)`: add new element `x` to List
	- `pop(idx)`: remove element at index `idx` from the list
	- Magic functions like `__str__`, `__add__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__lte__`, `__gte__`, `__add__`, `__mul__` and `__getitem__`.


10. Explore the `os` module in Python and write a Python program to:
	- List all files in a folder entered by user.
	- Rename any given file in the specified folder

11. Explore the `random` module and create a number guessing game using it.

13. Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file.
